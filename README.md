# Body Mass Index:
  Body mass index (BMI) is a value derived from the mass (weight) and height of a person. The BMI is defined as the body mass divided by the square of the body height, and is expressed in units of kg/m2, resulting from mass in kilograms and height in metres.
  
  The BMI is a convenient rule of thumb used to broadly categorize a person as underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese based on tissue mass (muscle, fat, and bone) and height. Major adult BMI classifications are underweight (under 18.5 kg/m2), normal weight (18.5 to 24.9), overweight (25 to 29.9), and obese (30 or more). When used to predict an individual's health, rather than as a statistical measurement for groups, the BMI has limitations that can make it less useful than some of the alternatives, especially when applied to individuals with abdominal obesity, short stature, or unusually high muscle mass.
  
 BMIs under 20 and over 25 have been associated with higher all-cause mortality, with the risk increasing with distance from the 20–25 range.

  # Category:
  1.Underweight - < 18.5(Possible nutritional deficiency and osteoporosis)
  2.Normal - 18.5 – 22.9(Low risk (healthy range))
  3.Mild to moderate overweight -	23.0 – 27.4	(Moderate risk of developing heart disease, high blood pressure, stroke, diabetes mellitus)
  4.Very overweight to obese - ≥ 27.5	(High risk of developing heart disease, high blood pressure, stroke, diabetes mellitus. Metabolic Syndrome)
# Tools and Languages used in the project:
1.The hompe page is developed completely using html where all the content there is written using appropriate html elements.The video html element was also added in this   page
2.The CSS style properties are used to style up these html elements using appropriate class names and id names for almost all the html elements.
  Some of the CSS properties that were involved with particular type of html elements are border properties,margin and padding properties,flex properties,text styling     and decoration properties and transformation as well as fadeout,fadein properties were used.
3.Javascript is most extensively used for developing the game logic in this game where some js properties like query selectors,onclick attributes,class name               attributes,set timeout attributes are used in conjunction with js objects,functions,variables and loops.
